<p>Kirsten Spruit (1993, NL) moves between artistic research, graphic design, writing and sound. With a special interest in time-based media and durational processes, she explores themes such as boredom, doubt and idleness within the context of technological acceleration and the hyperactive information age. She also draws a lot of dots and makes music as Personae.</p>
